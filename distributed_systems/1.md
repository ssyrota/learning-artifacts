**Application types:**

*Compute-intensive -* challenge in parallelizing some very large computation

*Data-intensive -* when data management is one of the primary challenges in developing the application:

- storing and processing large data volumes
- manage changes to data
- ensuring consistency in face of failures and concurrency
- making sure services is highly available

**Data warehouse vs data lake**

*Data warehouse -* OLAP database with data from business, has SQL interface

*Data lake* - centralized data repository that holds copy of any data which may be useful for analytics to perform any operations, like feature engineering using python

Systems of record and derived data

*System of record -* source of truth, e.g. event, user input, created_at

*Derived data systems -* result of taking data from system of record and processing it in some way.

**Cloud vs Self-Hosting**

Cloud:

- Can scale machines fast
- Doesnâ€™t require setup
